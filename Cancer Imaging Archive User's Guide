# What's New in the TCIA Data Portal
August 2021
The NBIA Data Retriever has been updated to version 4.1.
A command line interface is now available for Linux (CentOS and Ubuntu) users that does not require the desktop environment. 
As of version 4.0, the Data Description URI is included in the metadata file you download if you export the cart as a spreadsheet. 
You can now resume a download if you closed the NBIA Data Retriever in the middle of a download, as long as you choose the same download directory as you originally did before the interruption. You can specify whether you want to download just the missing series or download all of the series in the original manifest file. See Downloading Images Using the NBIA Data Retriever for an updated procedure.
You must now accept the TCIA Data Usage Policy before proceeding to download data. This policy is now also included in the license file. See Downloading Images Using the NBIA Data Retriever for an updated procedure.
The NBIA Data Retriever now warns you if there are series in your download that have commercial use restrictions.
More technical features in this release include replacing Oracle Java 8 with Amazon-Corretto as the embedded Java runtime environment and several bug fixes.
Introduction to the TCIA Data Portal
TCIA Data Portal enables you to search for images in the local TCIA in vivo image repository. If available, you can also search remote imaging archives.

TCIA submissions are organized in the following hierarchy, which is important to remember in creating your search query and reviewing search results:

Collection > Patient (Subject) > Study > Series > Images

In other words, a Collection is the largest organizing concept within TCIA and it includes data about Patients (also called Subjects). As you continue to drill down to more granular concepts, Patients contain Studies, Studies contain (Image) Series, and Series contain individual Images.

# Searching for Image Studies
You can search and download public data without logging in to the TCIA Data Portal. To access restricted data, however, you must log in first to see that data in your search results.
TCIA provides two ways to search for image studies:

* Simple Search
* Text Search
When you first open TCIA Data Portal, the Summary tab displays filters for a simple search and pie charts showing counts of collections, image modalities, and anatomical sites in the database. Each pie "slice" is a filter you can use to narrow the data in the portal. Hover over a pie chart slice to view the name of each filter. The size of each pie slice is relative to the size of that filter's representation in the database. 

TCIA Simple Search page with Simple Search options and Summary tab visible

Click one or more boxes next to each search filter to select it. As you select search filters, they move to the top of the list. They also appear in Boolean query format above the pie charts. This query specifies the filters you have applied to your search. Click Clear if you want to remove all of your filters at once and start over. You can save your query as a URL for later use or to put in an email to a colleague. For more information about sharing, go to Sharing Data in Your Cart.

You can narrow your search by the following filters:

* Collections
* Image Modality
* Anatomical Site
* Species
* Phantoms
* 3rd-Party Analysis Results
* Clinical Time Points
* Exclude collections with commercial use restrictions
* Date Released
* Subject IDs
You can also specify the minimum number of image studies you want to match each search filter. For Collections, if you know the name of the collection, click Magnifying glass icon to enter it instead of finding and clicking the collection's box.

3rd-party analysis results are derived data (e.g. segmentations) that were contributed by researchers who were not part of the group that originally submitted a collection to TCIA.

The Simple Search page shows a summary of image studies that match your search criteria. Your selections appear in the following ways:

Boxes you selected are checked.
Pie charts update to show the exact search results.
Breadcrumb-style labels at the top of the page show the applied search filters (not all may display due to space constraints).
Count of search results appears.
Simple Search tab showing selections and summary of search results

The pie charts show the count of image studies in your search results by Collection, Image Modality, and Anatomical Site. Click a pie slice or hover over it to see the name of the Collection, Image Modality, or Anatomical Site, and number of each, in your search results.

Count by Collections with selected search filter and filter name

The Search Results tab shows the same results as the pie charts but in tabular form.

Search Results in tabular form, showing the first 10 of 20 Subjects and highlighting them as well as the search query (40-Lung plus CT)

Text searches involve entering any text that might appear in any search filter.

Text Search tab with Text Search box within it

Results are displayed in pie charts and a table, just as with the simple search.

# Accessing Limited-Access Collections
You can search and download public data without logging in to the TCIA Data Portal. To access restricted data, however, you must log in first to see that data in your search results. Consult the TCIA Collections page to learn which collections have limited access.

In the top menu bar, click Login Button.
The Login window appears.
Login window
Enter your user name and password, then click Log In.
Performing a Simple Search
A simple search allows you to search for image studies based on a combination of the following search filters: Collections, Image Modality, Anatomical Site, Species, Phantoms, Third-Party Analysis Results, Date released on TCIA, and Subject IDs. The more criteria you select, the fewer results you receive. 
To perform a simple search

On the TCIA home page, click the Simple Search tab.
The Simple Search page appears.

Select filters to narrow down the available image series.

Collections

Option 1: Click the box next to each collection name you want to select.

4D-Lung Collection selected

Hovering over a collection name opens a window with information about the collection in it. Quickly move your mouse to this window, where you can select text and click links. The window stays open until you move your mouse away from it. 

4D-Lung This data collection consists of images acquired during chemoradiotherapy of 20 locally-advanced, non-small cell lung cancer patients. The images include four-dimensional (4D) fan beam (4D-FBCT) and 4D cone beam CT (4D-CBCT). All patients underwent concurrent radiochemotherapy to a total dose of 64.8-70 Gy using daily 1.8 or 2 Gy fractions.  A single Radiation Oncologist delineated targets and organs at risk in all 4D-FBCT and a limited number of 4D-CBCT images. All patients underwent concurrent radiochemotherapy to a total dose of 64.8-70 Gy using daily 1.8 or 2 Gy fractions.  Please see the 4D-Lung wiki page to learn more about the images and to obtain any supporting metadata for this collection.


Option 2: Click the magnifying glass to enter a name.
Collections filter highlighting the search box and magnifying glass

Image Modality 

Click the box next to one or more image modalities.

If you select more than one image modality, clicking ANY returns any study that is associated with any of the modalities you selected. Clicking ALL returns all studies that are associated with all of the modalities you selected.

When you select the ANY search modifier here, only the studies that match your search criteria are returned. Be aware that these may be only be a subset of the studies belonging to a single subject (patient). The potential difference between total studies available and the number of studies returned by your search  becomes clearer when you select the Total Studies and Total Series columns to appear in your search results. To do so, click at the top of the Search Results tab. Select Total Studies and Total Series in the Pick Columns list.

Pick columns list of choices, which includes Cart, Collection ID, Subject ID, Studies, Total Studies, Series, and Total Series.

Checklist of image modalities with CT selected

Anatomical Site

 Click the box next to each anatomical site you want to select. Click alpha or num to sort the list alphabetically or numerically. Select Not Specified to find data for which the BodyPartExamined field is empty.

Species

Click the box next to the species you want your search results to represent, either human or Mus musculus (mouse).

Phantoms

Click the box next to the phantom option you want to select.

Phantoms search filter. Options are Only Phantoms, Exclude Phantoms, and Include Phantoms.

3rd-Party Analysis Results

Third-party analysis results are derived data (e.g. segmentations) that were contributed by researchers who were not part of the group that originally submitted a collection to TCIA. To enhance the value of TCIA collections, TCIA encourages the research community to publish their analyses of existing TCIA image collections. Examples of this kind of data includes radiologist or pathologist annotations, image classifications, segmentations, radiomics features, or derived/reprocessed images.

Click the box next to each third-party analysis results option you want to select. Only DICOM data from third-party analysis results appear when using this search filter. A full listing of all third-party analysis data inclusive of non-DICOM formats appears in the Analysis Results Directory. 

Clinical Time Points

Some datasets encode Clinical Time Point information in the image metadata. This filter allows you to refine search results based on how many days have passed since a particular clinical event occurred when these metadata are included by the data submitter (e.g. "Days since diagnosis"). Click select to view the types that are available in the database, plus their available date range. In the from and to boxes, enter numbers that correspond to the range of days from and to that time point.

Exclude collections with commercial use restrictions

TCIA supports collections with different types of licenses. Some licenses prohibit the commercial use of the collection. You can filter your search results to exclude those collections that have commercial use restrictions.

At least X time point (DICOM studies)	
Enter the minimum number of time points that match the criteria of your search. This filter allows you to see subjects that have more than one DICOM study (that is, the patient was seen at multiple time points).

At least X (number) time point (DICOM studies) field

Date Released

Enter a From and To date to narrow your search results to studies that TCIA first made available during that date range.

Alternately, select the Apply "Available" date range box to exclude studies that were unavailable to TCIA during the selected date range. Click the Arrow turning in a counter-clockwise direction button to return the dates to the default date range.

Date Released search filter

Subject IDs	
Enter Subject IDs associated with the image series you want to receive in your search results. Separate each Subject ID with a comma and then click Apply Subject IDs.

Subject IDs text box

Select which columns you want to have appear in the detailed search results on the Search Results tab by clicking at the top of the Search Results tab. The Pick Columns panel appears. 

Pick columns list of choices, which includes Cart, Collection ID, Subject ID, Studies, Total Studies, Series, and Total Series.

Search results are shown in two different ways, as a summary and as detailed search results, and which one appears first matches your last choice. The Summary tab shows updated pie charts and the number of image series in the search results.

# Performing a Text Search
A text search allows you to query many of the database fields, DICOM image tag data and their values, and annotation files that are not available in the Simple search. You can also use the text search to query for content of DICOM Structured Reports (DICOM SR) and strains from mouse and rat collections. Refer to the DICOM Data Dictionary for tags or field names you can use in a text search and Structure of DICOM SR Documents for a description of the fields in a DICOM SR.
DICOM Examples

Enter pancreas in the Text Search box and find all subjects associated with the value pancreas.
Query using the attribute:searchTerm technique: for example, Body Part Examined:pancreas. In this example, the colon interprets the DICOM field from the value.
Query by DICOM codes, such as 0018,0015:pancreas. 0018,0015 is the DICOM code for Body Part Examined.
Query by DICOM SR attributes, such as 0008,0104 for Code Meaning. Entering 0008,0104:tonsil, returns all subjects with a Code Meaning that includes the word "tonsil," and 0008,0104:tonsil adenoid returns all subjects with a Code Meaning that includes both "tonsil" and "adenoid." 
Use a wildcard search such as Body Part Examined:panc* to find all subjects associated with values beginning with panc, including pancreas, pancreatic duct, and pancreatic duct and bile duct systems.
Examples for Strains

Query for the strain name or parts of the strain name or use a value name pair to construct the query. You can query by the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) number or query for MGI in the coding scheme designator field. Examples follow.
Strain Description (0010,0212) = "NOD.Cg-Prkdc<scid> Il2rg<tm1Wjl>/SzJ"
Strain Nomenclature (0010,0213) = "MGI_2013"
Strain Code Sequence (0010,0219):
 Code Value (0008,0100) = "3577020"
 Coding Scheme Designator (0008,0102) = "MGI"
 Code Meaning I0008,0103) = "NOD.Cg-Prkdc<scid> Il2rg<tm1Wjl>/SzJ"
The text search does have some restrictions. These are:

The text string you use must have more than one character. The search won't return any values if the text string has only one character.
Do not use a forward slash (/) in your text string.
Do not use complex searches with AND or OR statements (text search supports Lucene syntax but only a single field can be searched at a time).
To perform a text search

On the TCIA home page, click Text Search or Search Images > Text Search.
The Text Search page appears.

Text Search tab with an empty text box, Clear button, and Search button

In the Text Search box, enter a text string of two characters or more.
Click Search button.
The search results appear.

If you choose Download all, the existing download folder will be overwritten with all of the series in the original manifest file. If you choose Download missing series, only those series you have not previously downloaded appear in the Downloads table in the NBIA Data Retriever window, then download only those series.


NBIA Data Retriever File Naming System

The file naming system used by the NBIA Data Retriever provides a natural ordering of the files within each series. The DICOM files are first ordered by ordinal position of acquisition number and then by ordinal position of instance number. The files are then assigned numbers with the lowest acquisition being 1 and the lowest instance number within that acquisition being 1, separated by a dash. The numbers are incremented by 1 as the next values are encountered. All values are left-padded with zeros to provide for the ordering within the file system. 

As an example, a series with 2 acquisition numbers with each acquisition having 42 instance numbers would start with 1-01.dcm for the lowest acquisition number and the lowest instance number in that acquisition. The last file in that acquisition would be 1-42.dcm.  Then the second acquisition would start with 2-01.dcm, ending with 2-42.dcm, in that acquisition. For the purposes of ordering, an empty value in either acquisition number or instance number is lower than an file having a value for those number.

Click Browse to navigate to the destination where you want the images/annotations to be downloaded.

Click Start to begin the download. You can monitor the status of the full download in the progress bar on top, and for each collection in the Progress column. The Status column indicates when the download for each item is complete.
At any point in the process, you can click the Pause and Resume buttons to temporarily stop and restart the process.

The downloaded files are stored in a child folder under the destination folder such as Collection Name > Patient ID > part of Study Date + part of Study ID + part of Study Description + last 5 digits of Study Instance UID > part of Series Number + part of Series Description + last 5 digits of Series Instance UID.

Network Error?

If network errors occur during large downloads, the NBIA Data Retriever retries downloading the series in the manifest file the number of times that your administrator has configured. The default is four times.

After the automatic retries, you have the option of retrying just the failed series, saving an error report, which you can share with the TCIA help desk, and exiting.
